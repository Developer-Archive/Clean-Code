# Clean Code :

This book gives an insight of how to oragnize your code as a professional programmer for maintainability purposes.

So, if your code is not clean enough for others to read, it would be tough for you to maintain it.

Looking at the same code from different prespectives shall help you to understand the theroy behind this book.

For instance, have a look at this code and try to reproduce a better version of it : 

#### Code example

At the end of this book, you should be able to differentiate between good and bad code and has the ability to refractor bad code into good maintainable code owing that you fully know the target project context pattern and algorithms.

Some arguments on the internet say that code is an old style and behind the times and there will be no more code in near future and it would be replaced by application generation engines and so on (which is also pretty code in its core), which is totally wrong, the complexity and the engineering needed in coding products would never be abandoned, these level of details at which we list the instructions for machines cannot be ignored or even abstracted.

## The total cost of owing a mess : 
- Lifelong maintainability is the key that tells us if the code is clean or not.
- Owing to have a bad ugly code would cost us a lot of time to maintain it and even though there would be a point where this maintainability would fall and break aparts.
- As the mess builds up, the productivity decreases, approaching zero in some cases.
- Having a stable pattern for the application and direct intention in solving problems from the beginning may increase the team productivity and decrease the time taken to drive a release and mess.

## The grand redesign in the sky : 
- If the mess continues, a redesign of the application is demanded, which with a new team coming up would be very hard to maintain if it wasn't, again, obvious and clear from the beginning.

## Attitude : 
- Graving through a mess takes weeks and even months and years to finish.
- Taking your time to write a clean code with obvious and direct pattern from the beginning shall help to overcome these problems which by far decreases the productivity by increasing the time to drive a release through increasing the mess.
- Don't ever rush to code, at least first solve your application problem and reach a stable solution domain with your team through understanding the problem domain from the project manager.
- Then, start by collecting names for packages and utilities your team will build.
- Then, state a stable design patterns for different parts of your product.
- And finally, distribute the work on your team and start your project, don't ever rush to code before knowing the problem and the solution domains.
- Messes should never be an excuse in order to finish before deadlines.
- The only way to make it before deadline-the only way to go fast-is to keep the code clean as possible at all times from the beginning.
- Proper packaging and contexting techniques are from the first drives of clean code.
- Proper writing of functions and methods lies on the second hand.
- And, proper problem analysis and solution designs are the core of clean code.
